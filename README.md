The goal of this game is for players to avoid obstacles (barriers and grease spills) and instead collect fuel cans to earn points. 

Some of the frameworks and ideals that I used for this project are:
- Sprite kit
- a moving background (SKAnimation)
- Swipe Gesture recognizers (with restrictions - the car can only move three spots)
- Timer.schedule()
- Segues
- Physics body
- Bit masks
- + more
